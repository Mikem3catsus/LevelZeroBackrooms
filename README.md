# Level Zero

A [Backrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms) inspired Gameboy game written using [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) and [Pyxel Edit](https://pyxeledit.com/).

Drawing inspiration from multiple sources:
 * [Fandom Wiki](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Backrooms_Wiki)
 * [Wikidot](http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/)

Each of the graphics assets was created in Pyxel edit and then exported as a .png for use in GB Studio.

Inside the assets directory is `pallet.png` file to use in Pyxel edit with the menu "Color->Import from image".
The first 5 colors match the [image requirements](https://www.gbstudio.dev/docs/assets/sprites#image-requirements) in GB Studio.

Using GB Studio, open the "LevelZero.gbstudio" file and you can then run it using the "play" icon in the upper right, or build and export it using the "Game->Export as" menu.

The goal of this project is to learn how to make basic games and have fun doing it.
