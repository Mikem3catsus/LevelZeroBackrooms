This is a high-level view of the game design to help guide the development progress by giving a roadmap to the overall structure and style of the game. It is intended to provide a framework for including ideas in a way that provides a consistent and enjoyable experience for players.

# Summary of the first levels:

Overall, these levels will challenge the player's puzzle-solving skills, observation skills, and ability to navigate through unfamiliar and unpredictable environments. They would also leverage the creepy and surreal atmosphere of the backrooms concept, creating a sense of unease and tension that is typical of horror games.

## Level 0: "Enter the Backrooms"

The player starts in the normal world, arriving at their workplace, A-Sync industries. When they enter the
building, they discover that things are not normal. Noone is there, hazmat suits are around and soon, they find strange high-energy devices that appear to be powering a black door. Proceeding through the door, they find themselves in the backrooms, where many of the rooms are identical and navigating presents challenges. There are a series of puzzles that must be completed to allow the player to progress deeper throught the level. 

## Level 1: "The Yellow Rooms"

The player finds themselves in a series of identical yellow rooms, all connected by secret passages or vents. The objective is to find the correct sequence of actions to escape, without getting caught by the wandering "entities" that lurk in the corners. The player must use their wits to avoid detection, distract or confuse the entities, and find the hidden switches that unlock the exit. The level gradually gets more complex and unpredictable, with different types of entities and environmental hazards.

## Level 2: "The Office"

The player finds themselves in a series of office rooms, with 1990's era office equipment, cubicles, meeting rooms, etctra, that goes on in an infinite-like maze. The Office is devoid of people adding to the unsettling emptiness of the level. The player must solve puzzles involving the office environment and equipment to proceed through the environment. Some of the puzzles and clues are obtained by using the computers in the office. The level gradually becomes increasingly empty and narrow leading to level 4.

## Level 3: "The Halls of Madness"
The player enters a seemingly endless corridor, filled with bizarre and surreal sights. The objective is to make it to the end of the corridor by solving increasingly difficult puzzles and avoiding the traps and obstacles. The player must use their observation skills to notice patterns, hidden symbols, or secret paths that are invisible to the naked eye. The level gradually gets more psychedelic and challenging, with mind-bending illusions, hallucinations, and paradoxes.

## Level 4: "The Basement"
The player finds themselves in a dimly lit basement, filled with strange machines and equipment. The objective is to uncover the secret purpose of the machines and use them to escape. The player must explore the basement, repair broken devices, and decipher cryptic messages to activate the correct sequence of buttons and levers. The level gradually gets more mechanical and futuristic, with advanced gadgets and hidden passages.

## Level 5: "The Endless Stairs"
The player climbs a seemingly endless spiral staircase, leading to a mysterious destination. The objective is to make it to the top of the stairs by overcoming various obstacles and challenges. The player must avoid falling off the stairs, dodge moving obstacles, or solve puzzles to unlock the next section of the stairs. The level gradually gets more vertiginous and dizzying, with changing gravity, shifting stairs, and unexpected twists.


# Level 0: "Enter the Backrooms"

Level 0, "Enter the Backrooms," is the first level of the game and serves as an introduction to the backrooms concept. The level is designed to be relatively straightforward and easy to navigate, while still providing a sense of danger and unease.

When the player first enters the level, they find themselves in a dark, musty room with no apparent exits. The room is poorly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights and peeling wallpaper. The walls are covered in a pattern of yellowish stains and strange symbols, giving the impression of an abandoned building or a forgotten storage room.

The objective of the level is to find the correct way out of the room and into the maze-like structure of the backrooms. To do so, the player must solve a series of simple puzzles and obstacles, such as:


As the player progresses through the level, the backrooms gradually become more complex and challenging. The rooms become darker and more claustrophobic, with narrow corridors, low ceilings, and an increasing sense of danger and uncertainty.

The ultimate goal of the level is to reach the exit, which is behind a series of puzzles that must be completed for the player to progress through the levels.

# Level 1: "The Yellow Rooms"

Level 1, "The Yellow Rooms," is a puzzle level set in a series of identical yellow rooms connected by secret passages or vents. The level is designed to be more challenging than the first level, with more complex puzzles and obstacles that require the player to think creatively and strategically.

When the player enters the level, they find themselves in a small, bright yellow room with no apparent exit. The walls and floors are covered in a uniform yellow color, with no distinguishable features or patterns. The player must use their observation skills to find hidden clues or paths that lead to the next room.

The objective of the level is to navigate through the series of yellow rooms and find the correct sequence of actions to escape, without getting caught by the wandering "entities" that lurk in the corners. To do so, the player must solve a series of puzzles and obstacles, such as:

The backrooms are also home to various environmental hazards, such as:

 * Crumbling or unstable structures that can collapse and trap the player
 * Toxic or hazardous materials that can harm the player if touched
 * Electrical malfunctions or fires that can cause damage to the player or the environment

The ultimate goal of the level is to find the exit, which is located on the top floor of the building.

Once the player defeats the entity and escapes the building, they can proceed to the next level.


# Level 3: "The Halls of Madness"

Level 3, "The Halls of Madness" is a challenging puzzle level set in a maze of twisting, interconnected hallways within the backrooms. The level is designed to be the most difficult and complex level in the game, with a variety of obstacles and puzzles that will test the player's problem-solving skills and strategic thinking.

When the player enters the level, they find themselves in a dimly lit, claustrophobic hallway that seems to go on forever. The walls are covered in peeling wallpaper, and the floorboards creak underfoot. As the player moves deeper into the maze of hallways, they will encounter a variety of traps, puzzles, and obstacles that must be overcome to progress.

The objective of the level is to navigate through the maze-like hallways and find the exit, all while avoiding the various "entities" that inhabit the backrooms. To do so, the player must solve a series of complex puzzles and obstacles, such as:

 * Finding hidden switches or levers that activate hidden passages or unlock doors
 * Deciphering cryptic messages or codes that reveal the next step
 * Avoiding traps and hazards, such as falling ceilings or collapsing floors
 * Using mirrors or other reflective surfaces to redirect light beams and activate mechanisms

As the player progresses through the level, the maze becomes more complex and challenging. The player must navigate through multiple levels of hallways, each with their own unique layouts and puzzles to solve. The entities become more intelligent and aggressive, making it harder for the player to avoid detection.

The backrooms are also home to various environmental hazards, such as:

 * Strange sounds and hallucinations that can disorient the player

Once the player defeats the entity and escapes the maze, they can complete the game.


# Level 4: "The Basement"


Level 4, "The Basement" is a spooky and unsettling puzzle level set in the depths of the backrooms. The level is designed to be atmospheric and tense, with a focus on exploration and discovery.

When the player enters the level, they find themselves in a dark and musty basement, filled with cobwebs and dust. The basement is made up of a series of interconnected rooms and corridors, each with their own unique atmosphere and secrets to uncover. The player must explore the basement, searching for clues and solving puzzles to uncover the truth behind what happened there.

The objective of the level is to solve a series of puzzles and mysteries related to the history of the basement. The player must use their problem-solving skills to uncover the secrets of the basement and unlock new areas to explore. Puzzles may include:

 * Strange and unexplainable sounds and phenomena, such as whispering voices or ghostly apparitions
 * Disturbing imagery and symbols, hinting at a dark and sinister past
 * The presence of entities or other dangers lurking in the shadows

The ultimate goal of the level is to uncover the truth behind the basement's dark past and escape with your life. Once the player has solved all of the puzzles and uncovered all of the secrets, they can find the exit and proceed to the next level.

The machines in the basement are a key element of the puzzle-solving in the level. These machines are old and rusted, and appear to have been abandoned for years. However, they still hold clues to the history and secrets of the basement.

There are several different types of machines in the basement, each with their own unique function and purpose. Some machines may be broken or damaged, requiring the player to find and collect replacement parts to repair them. Other machines may be operational, but require the player to solve puzzles or input codes to activate them.

The machines may be used in a variety of ways to progress through the level. For example, the player may need to:

 * Activate a generator to restore power to a darkened area of the basement
 * Use a crane to move heavy objects and access new areas
 * Input codes into a control panel to unlock hidden passages
 * Repair a ventilation system to access areas filled with toxic gas
 * Use a boiler to heat up water and clear ice blocking a doorway

However, using the machines is not always easy. They may require the player to find and collect specific tools or items to operate them, or they may require precise timing or coordination to use effectively. The machines may also be guarded by entities or other dangers, adding an element of danger and suspense to the level.

Overall, the machines in the basement add an element of mechanical puzzle-solving to the level, requiring the player to think creatively and strategically to progress through the dark and creepy environment.

The Endless Stairs is designed to test the player's resilience and determination, as well as their ability to think creatively and adapt to unexpected challenges. It is a unique and memorable puzzle experience that will leave a lasting impression on the player.
